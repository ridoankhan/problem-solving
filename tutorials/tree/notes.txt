three rules to become a tree
1. exactly 1 root node
2. Can have at most 2 child nodes
3. There in exactly 1 way to reach a node inside the tree


Depth-First-Values (algorithm)

* we can traverse the tree using 
  -> pre-order = root -> left -> right
  -> in-order = left -> root -> right
  -> post-order = left -> right -> root
