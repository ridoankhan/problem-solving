# tuples is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable and allows duplicate values

# create tuple
fruits = ('Apple', 'Orange', 'Grapes')

# using constructor
# fruits2 = tuple(('Apple', 'Orange', 'Grape'))

# singel value need trailing comma
# fruits2 = ('Apple',)

# get specific value
# print(fruits[1])

# can't change a value, thus the following statement is invalid
# fruits[0] = 'Pears'

# delete a tuple from the memory
# del fruits

print(len(fruits))

# A set is a collection which is unordered and uintended. no duplicate members
