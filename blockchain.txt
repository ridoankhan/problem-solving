Blockchain fundamentals:
What is blockchain technology and how does it work?
Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that enables secure and transparent transactions without the need for intermediaries. It works by recording transactions in a chronological chain of blocks that are cryptographically linked and distributed across a network of computers or nodes.
What are the key components of a blockchain?
The key components of a blockchain include the cryptographic hash function, digital signature, peer-to-peer network, consensus mechanism, and smart contract.
What are some use cases for blockchain technology?
Some use cases for blockchain technology include cryptocurrency transactions, supply chain management, identity verification, voting systems, and data storage and management.
Smart contracts:
What is a smart contract and how does it work?
A smart contract is a self-executing computer program that automatically enforces the terms of a contract between two or more parties. It works by using if-then statements to trigger actions based on specific conditions.
What programming languages can be used to write smart contracts?
Solidity is the most popular programming language used to write smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Other programming languages include Vyper, Serpent, and LLL.
What are some examples of real-world applications of smart contracts?
Real-world applications of smart contracts include insurance policies, supply chain management, digital identity verification, and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.
Consensus algorithms:
What is a consensus algorithm and why is it important in blockchain?
A consensus algorithm is a set of rules that enables nodes on a blockchain network to agree on the state of the ledger. It is important in blockchain because it ensures that all nodes have a consistent and accurate copy of the ledger.
What are some popular consensus algorithms and how do they differ from each other?
Popular consensus algorithms include Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), and Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT). They differ from each other in terms of their security, scalability, and energy efficiency.
What are the pros and cons of different consensus algorithms?
PoW is secure but energy-intensive, PoS is more energy-efficient but may be less secure, DPoS is faster but may be more centralized, and BFT is fault-tolerant but may be slower.
Cryptography:
What role does cryptography play in blockchain?
Cryptography is used in blockchain to secure transactions and protect the privacy and identity of participants. It is also used to ensure the integrity of the ledger by making it tamper-proof.
What are some common cryptographic algorithms used in blockchain?
Common cryptographic algorithms used in blockchain include SHA-256, RIPEMD-160, ECDSA, and AES.
What are the benefits and drawbacks of different cryptographic algorithms?
The benefits of different cryptographic algorithms depend on their specific use case. For example, SHA-256 is a secure and widely-used hash function, while ECDSA is a widely-used digital signature algorithm. The drawbacks of different cryptographic algorithms may include their computational complexity and potential vulnerabilities.
Ethereum:
What is Ethereum and how does it differ from Bitcoin?
Ethereum is a blockchain platform that enables the creation and execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). It differs from Bitcoin in that it is programmable and supports a wider range of applications beyond simple transactions.
What is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and how does it work?
The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a virtual machine that runs smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It works by executing code in a sandboxed environment,

ensuring that the code is secure and preventing malicious actions from impacting the network.

What are some of the key features and benefits of Ethereum?
Some of the key features and benefits of Ethereum include its programmability, support for smart contracts and dApps, scalability solutions like sharding and layer-2 networks, and the ability to create custom tokens and launch initial coin offerings (ICOs).
Technical skills:
What programming languages are commonly used in blockchain development?
Some programming languages commonly used in blockchain development include Solidity, JavaScript, Go, Rust, and C++.
What development tools and frameworks are used in blockchain development?
Some popular development tools and frameworks used in blockchain development include Truffle Suite, Remix IDE, Ganache, and Hardhat.
